    Well, there's nothing else I need to do today so let's take a nap.

    Well, It's not gonna hurt if I sleep more...

*{not TakenNap}Lets take a nap
    After an hour passed, I woke up but felt like doing nothing.

    ->Naps
* {TakenNap}get out of bed
    {count > 5: That was a {count} hour nap.}

    -> MainLoop
*{not TakenNap}Lets not take a nap
    I probably shouldn't get in the habit of taking naps.
