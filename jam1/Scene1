Let's hop on my pc.
There so many things I can do right now, but what I really want to do is play some games right now.

+{Time < 24}Lets play {not PlayedGame: Valorant|another...} 
    {not PlayedGame : Nothing better than playing Valorant right now. I should be able to reach Ascendant soon... | Mind aswell play another game.}
    
    ~temp game = RANDOM(-1,1)
    After a hard fought game, my team and I {game == 1: won}{game == -1: lost}{game== 0: draw} the game.
    ~Happiness += game
    ~PlayedGame = true
    ~Time += 1

*Do some homework
    I guess its time to do my ECON100A homework that I've been procrastinating. The problems weren't hard but due to how boring it was, Youtube ended up increasing the time I spent on this.
    ~Time += 1
    ~Happiness -= 1
    ~DoneHomework = true
    ~PlayedGame = false
